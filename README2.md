Since I've been sick I couldn't really work on it too much. I added the nav bar and the cards to display a static version.

Later I would add logic were everytime I click an image it would randomnize the boxes and store the Id in an array.

If the next click or any more is in an array by id you lose.

the score would increment by 1 until you select the wrong one.

IF you select the wrong one the game restarts with a game over message and resets score to 0.

If the score you had was greater than previous high score then it pushes the high score and replaces it.

I would also add more css styleing to make it look nicer.
